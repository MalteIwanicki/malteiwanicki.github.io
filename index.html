            <h2>Greetings</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior software engineer with expertise in data processing, analysis, and exploration.
                Combining a BSc in Informatics and an MFA in Arts, I aim to deliver minimalistic, elegant, and creative
                solutions for complex problems. My work emphasizes problem solving, creativity, data analysis,
                and visualization. Most of my experience is based on Python, JavaScript, and cloud services from
                AWS and Azure, but I am also comfortable across other languages and technologies.
                I love to learn and advance my skills while continuously optimizing my workflow.
